# Documentation for `simple_token_7io10jj.aleo` Leo Program

## Overview
This Leo program, named `simple_token_7io10jj.aleo`, demonstrates the process of minting and transferring tokens within the Aleo blockchain framework. It defines a `Token` data structure and includes functionality for initializing token records.

## File Description
- **Filename**: `main.leo`
- **Purpose**: To illustrate token minting and transferring in the Leo language.

## Data Structure
### Token
- **Type**: Record
- **Fields**:
  1. `owner`: Address
     - Description: Represents the address of the token owner.
     - Type: `address`
  2. `amount`: u64
     - Description: Represents the quantity of tokens.
     - Type: `u64` (64-bit unsigned integer)

## Functions
### mint
- **Purpose**: Initializes a new `Token` record with a specified number of tokens assigned to a specified receiver.
- **Usage**:
  - Can be invoked using the command `leo run mint` from the terminal.
- **Parameters**:
  - _Receiver Address_: The address to which the tokens will be assigned.
  - _Token Amount_: The number of tokens to be minted and assigned.

## Example Usage
To use the `mint` function to create a new token:
1. Run the command `leo run mint` from the terminal.
2. Provide the necessary parameters (receiver address and token amount).

## Notes
- This code is intended for demonstration purposes within the Aleo blockchain environment.
- Modifications and extensions can be made to suit specific use-cases or to add additional functionality.

## Additional Information
- For further details on working with Leo and Aleo, refer to [Aleo documentation](https://aleo.org/documentation/).
- For general queries or support, join the Aleo community forum or discussion boards.
